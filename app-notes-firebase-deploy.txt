need to run a build of your react app first, so do:
npm run build

This will create a build dir and populate it with a build that can be deployed. If you want to run in l
locally you have to install a static server. Can do this:
npm install -g serve

Then do this to run it. It will tell you what port it is running on:
serve -s build

/\* To HOST in Firebase Hosting \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***/
To statically host we will use Firebase Hosting
Install firebase-tools like this:
npm install -g firebase-tools

login to firebase cli with your google account:
firebase login


currently need to do this to get firebase init to work: 
unset NODE_OPTIONS

Then in the project folder for your app use cli to run:
firebase init

Choose this: ◯ Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys
I created a new project with an ID of event-booking-frontend and a
project name of event-booking-app. Says you can use the same name but seems you cannot.

It then asks a bunch of config questions. I chose these options per Max:

? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i Skipping write of build/index.html

make sure you have a current build in your build dir and then run deploy:
firebase deploy
