/\* To HOST in Firebase Hosting \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***/
To statically host we will use Firebase Hosting
Install firebase-tools like this:
npm install -g firebase-tools

login to firebase cli with your google account:
firebase login


Then in the project folder for your app use cli to run:
firebase init

Choose the hosting option with space and then confirm with enter.
I created a new project with an ID of event-booking-frontend and a
project name of event-booking-app. Says you can use the same name but seems you cannot.

It then asks a bunch of config questions. I chose these options per Max:

? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i Skipping write of build/index.html

make sure you have a current build in your build dir and then run deploy:
firebase deploy
